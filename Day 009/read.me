# Day 9: Dictionaries, Nesting & Data Structures 📚

## What I Learned Today
- **Dictionaries**: Key-value pairs for organizing data
- **Nesting**: Lists within dictionaries, dictionaries within lists
- **Dictionary methods**: `.keys()`, `.values()`, `.items()`
- **Data structure design**: Choosing the right structure for the problem
- **User input handling**: Building interactive programs

## The Challenges
Built TWO complete projects:
1. **Grading System** - Convert scores to letter grades with dictionary logic
2. **Blind Auction** - Secret bidding program with nested data structures

## Key Concepts Applied

### 1. **Dictionary Basics**
```python
student = {
    "name": "Daniel",
    "score": 95,
    "grade": "A"
}
```

### 2. **Nesting Dictionaries in Lists**
```python
students = [
    {"name": "Daniel", "score": 95},
    {"name": "Alice", "score": 87},
]
```

### 3. **Nesting Lists in Dictionaries**
```python
travel_log = {
    "Nigeria": ["Lagos", "Abuja", "Port Harcourt"],
    "USA": ["New York", "Houston", "Los Angeles"]
}
```

### 4. **Nested Dictionaries**
```python
students_dict = {
    "Daniel": {"score": 95, "grade": "A"},
    "Alice": {"score": 87, "grade": "B"}
}
```

## What I Built

### Project 1: Grading System
A program that:
- Takes student scores as input
- Stores data in dictionaries
- Converts numerical scores to letter grades
- Displays organized results

### Project 2: Blind Auction
A secret bidding program that:
- Collects bids from multiple users
- Stores bidder names and amounts
- Hides previous bids (screen clear)
- Determines and announces the winner

**Key Challenge:** Keeping bids secret while collecting from multiple users!

## Real-World Applications

**Dictionaries are everywhere:**
- User profiles (name, email, password)
- Product catalogs (ID, name, price, stock)
- API responses (JSON data)
- Database records
- Configuration files

**Nesting enables complex data:**
- Social media posts (user info + comments + likes)
- E-commerce (orders with multiple items)
- School systems (students with multiple courses)

## Code Highlights

### Grading Logic
```python
student_scores = {
    "Daniel": 95,
    "Alice": 87,
    "Bob": 72
}

student_grades = {}

for student in student_scores:
    score = student_scores[student]
    if score > 90:
        student_grades[student] = "A"
    elif score > 80:
        student_grades[student] = "B"
    elif score > 70:
        student_grades[student] = "C"
    else:
        student_grades[student] = "F"

print(student_grades)
```

### Blind Auction Structure
```python
bids = {}

def add_bid(name, amount):
    bids[name] = amount

def find_winner(bidding_record):
    highest_bid = 0
    winner = ""
    for bidder in bidding_record:
        bid_amount = bidding_record[bidder]
        if bid_amount > highest_bid:
            highest_bid = bid_amount
            winner = bidder
    print(f"The winner is {winner} with a bid of ${highest_bid}")
```

## Challenges Overcome
- Understanding when to use lists vs dictionaries
- Navigating nested data structures
- Clearing screen between bids (platform-specific)
- Finding maximum value in dictionary
- Handling user input validation

## Key Takeaways
1. **Dictionaries** = perfect for labeled data (keys give meaning)
2. **Lists** = perfect for ordered collections
3. **Nesting** = combines both for complex real-world data
4. **Always plan your data structure** before coding
5. Dictionaries make data retrieval FAST (no looping needed!)
