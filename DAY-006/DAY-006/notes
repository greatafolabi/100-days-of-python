 Day 006 - Quick Notes

## Topics Covered:
- Functions (defining and calling)
- Code blocks & indentation (deep dive)
- While loops
- Karel the Robot / Reeborg's World
- Problem decomposition
- Algorithms (right-hand rule)

## Functions:
```python
# Defining a function
def function_name():
    # code here
    pass

# Calling a function
function_name()
```

## Why Functions?
- **DRY:** Don't Repeat Yourself
- Reusability
- Organization
- Easier debugging
- Break complex problems into pieces

## Indentation Rules:
- 4 spaces OR 1 tab per level
- Consistent throughout code
- Defines code blocks
- Wrong indentation = error
- Python reads whitespace!

## While Loops:
```python
while condition:
    # code runs while condition is True
    # must update condition eventually!
```

## For vs While:
- **For:** Known iterations (for i in range(10))
- **While:** Condition-based (while not at_goal())

## Karel/Reeborg Functions:
```python
move()              # Move forward
turn_left()         # Turn left 90°
put_beeper()        # Place object
pick_beeper()       # Pick up object
front_is_clear()    # Returns True if can move
right_is_clear()    # Check right side
at_goal()           # Check if at destination
```

## Custom Functions Created:
```python
def turn_right():
    turn_left()
    turn_left()
    turn_left()

def jump():
    move()
    turn_left()
    move()
    turn_right()
    move()
    turn_right()
    move()
    turn_left()
```

## Problem Decomposition:
1. Break big problem into small pieces
2. Solve each piece (create function)
3. Combine pieces into solution
4. Test and debug

## Right-Hand Rule (Maze Solving):
```
Algorithm:
1. If right is clear → turn right, move
2. Else if front is clear → move
3. Else → turn left
4. Repeat until goal reached
```

## Key Insights:
- 3 left turns = 1 right turn!
- Check conditions before acting
- Algorithms = systematic rules
- Functions build on functions
- While loops for unknown iterations
- Visual feedback helps learning

## Common Patterns:

### Function Pattern:
```python
def custom_action():
    # series of basic actions
    # combined into one reusable function
```

### Condition Check Pattern:
```python
if obstacle_detected():
    avoid_obstacle()
else:
    continue_forward()
```

### While Loop Pattern:
```python
while not done():
    check_conditions()
    take_action()
```

## Projects Built:
1. **Hurdles** - Jump over obstacles
2. **Variable Hurdles** - Dynamic obstacle detection
3. **Escaping the Maze** - Algorithm implementation

## Concepts Mastered:
✅ Defining functions
✅ Calling functions
✅ Code organization
✅ While loops
✅ Condition checking
✅ Problem decomposition
✅ Algorithm implementation
✅ Visual programming (Reeborg)

## Real-World Applications:
- Code organization (functions everywhere!)
- Robotics (Karel-like logic)
- Game AI (pathfinding)
- Automation (condition-based loops)
- Problem solving (decomposition)

## Important Reminders:
- Always indent consistently
- Make sure while loops can end
- Check conditions before acting
- Build complex from simple
- Test functions individually
- Think in small steps

## Ideas for Practice:
- Create more helper functions
- Solve different maze types
- Implement other algorithms
- Build robot simulations
- Practice decomposition on new problems
