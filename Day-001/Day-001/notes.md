# Day 001 - Quick Notes

## Topics Covered:
- print() function
- input() function  
- Variables and variable assignment
- Variable naming conventions (snake_case)
- String manipulation and concatenation

## Important Points:
- Variables don't need type declaration in Python
- input() always returns a string
- Use descriptive variable names
- Python is case-sensitive

## Syntax Learned:
```python
variable_name = value
print("text")
input("prompt text")
```

## Questions:
- How do I work with numbers vs strings?
- What other data types exist in Python?

## Ideas:
- Could expand this to ask more questions
- Could make it more creative with formatting
```
